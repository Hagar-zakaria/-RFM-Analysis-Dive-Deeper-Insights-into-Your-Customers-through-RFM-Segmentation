# What is RFM analysis ?
Imagine you run a store, and you want to figure out who your best customers are. Instead of getting lost in a sea of data, RFM helps you categorize customers based on when they last shopped with you (that's the '**"Recency"**'), how often they shop (that's the **"Frequency"**), and how much they tend to spend when they do (and that's the **"Monetary"** part).
